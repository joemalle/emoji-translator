Ah, ah, they made Droppa get sexy
Just when you thought it couldn't happen it did
But I ain't gonna do it by myself
I brought my guy with me, Mr. Yuh!
Ay bitches, y'all better get a Maxipad and put it on
'Cause you about to get wet, let's go, Trigga!

Lil' mama with them big old cheeks
Make a nigga wanna spend his check he made this week
Let them hoes get mad 'cause them hoes so weak
Spend a bag on your bag and your hair on fleek
Oh yeah, push that thing on me
You got me open, girl, but understand I'm a G
You just want the real so you hating on me
Niggas said they showing love but they hating on me

Yeah, go 'head with your cute ass
Whatever nigga fucked up is a dumbass
Let me make it right, girl, you deserve that
Sundresses make a nigga wanna grab that
Yeah, push that thing on me
Keep it so classy but I know you a freak
Tell me I ain't lying, take a ride with me
And pull up in this thing with me, let’s go

Push that thing on me
Jenny Lo' with the booty, sit that ass on me
Don't do it for the mirror, shake that ass for a G

You the best, keep it wet, that's a major key
Oh yeah, push that thing on me
Let these other niggas know you came with a G

Know that ass got some kick back, some kick back
Oh, go money, money
Let me spend this check on you, it ain't nothing, honey
Go money, money

Yup, it's the dark little big guy
Pushing no salt, no pepper, no french fries
I've been thinking 'bout your body but the inside
I ain't never hit it but you know that ass been mine
Push it like we on the incline
Push it like a door and then we walking inside
Unless you supposed to pull, that's a bad line
Best part of the game is the half time (it is!)
Chocolate about to get nasty with it
Droppa got you dripping so I had to kiss it
Never tripping on your pussy but I had to visit
Got my passport ready, let me grab a ticket
Baby, why you talking to them ashy niggas?
And stop drinking it alone, girl, pass the liquor
Got her in the corner, grab her ass, booty, butt
Now tell these motherfuckers they can catch me up in "What Now?", yeah
