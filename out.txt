You, with your words 👍 knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You, have knocked me off my feet again,
Got me feeling 👍 a nothing
You, with your voice 👍 nails
🔛 a chalk board, calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking 🔛 the weaker man
You can take me ⬇️
With just 🥇 single blow
But you don't know what you don't know
Someday I'll be living in a big 👵 city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
You, with your 🔀 sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already 👀 them
I walk with my head ⬇️,
Try to block you out 'cause I never impress you
